A concise weekly market commentary starting from 3Q24, highlighting recent economic data, relevant narratives and short-term market outlooks.
The objective of this document is to guide junior analysts of the Catolica Lisbon Investment Club in publishing quarterly newsletters on global markets.

While this commentary is not intended as investment advice, it offers insights derived from both discretionary and systematic approaches. It aims to provide valuable color and context that can inform important portfolio decisionsâ€“just as I personally use it. Enjoy!
