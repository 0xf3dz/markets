</head>
<body>

<h1>Key Takeaways from Q3 2024</h1>

<h2>16th - 22nd September Key Takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fed announces 50bps rate cut at FOMC</li>
    <li>Political move to support market interest and avoid recession fears, going into Sep OPEX (30th Sep)</li>
</ul>

<h2>23rd - 29th September Key Takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>China stimulus announcement on Tuesday 24th Sep:
        <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-unveils-broad-stimulus-measures-revive-economy-2024-09-24/">China unveils broad stimulus measures</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Market sentiment in China is generally bearish. New monetary policy causes lots of unwinding and squeezes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hang Seng Index rallies the most since 2008</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Chinese like luxury goods, LVMH surges</li>
    </ul>    
    <li>Nasdaq underperforms as investors sell it to bid on Chinese stocks</li>
    <ul>
        <li>“Window dressing”: money managers make sure to be in outperforming stocks at end of quarter to show good books to their clients</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Neighbouring Japanese markets see interest due to China stimulus</li>
    <ul>
        <li>UNTIL unexpected new PM Ishiga is elected (hawkish policies)</li>
        <li>As a consequence, investors sell Nikkei</li>
        <li>strong YEN bad for USD</li>
    </ul>    
    <li>China cut causes surge in commodity prices, EXCEPT OIL</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Why not oil? 
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d186f62-5941-4f9e-aef1-7d93a8a696cd">More supply hitting market = price stays down</a>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>JPMorgan Collar trade keeps market pinned until OPEX</li>
    <li>PCE comes in cold (0.1% vs 0.2%) – Consumers pay less for their goods and services, suggesting lower inflation this month. Good for the market.</li>
    <li>CPI in France and Spain came in much colder (1.2% vs 1.6%) indicating huge decrease in economic activity (deflation). Consumption and demand is dropping a lot. If inflation drops too fast and print negative MoM it’s alarming sign for central banks.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>ECB behind the curve</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Key Takeaways from Q4 2024</h1>

<h2>30th Sep - 6th Oct Key Takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>China in Golden Week holiday. Ironic how their markets had generational gains right before they get to spend them all during their holidays.</li>
    <li>Nike earnings this week – often used by boomers to gauge consumer inflation.</li>
    <li>Oil finally surges after Iran attacks Israel, market prices odds of escalation in the Middle East.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil squeezes as many investors (ie. Prime Book, GS) are short Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <li>ISM Manufacturing below 50, indicating contraction.</li>
    <li>ADP Employment comes in hot – good for the market, indicating expansion</li>
    <li>JPY/USD dumping as new PM gives more hawkish talks.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Good for tech stocks as YEN gets cheaper, more liquidity for the market in USD</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Not good for Nikkei</li>
    </ul>
    <li>This week, the market is more volatile, lacks supportive flows from Sep 30th OPEX. Vanna and Charm back next week.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Next week market becomes pinned again, and could chop chop up to the right.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>HSI continues to outperform as money rotates into Chinese markets from Mag7 and Nasdaq.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Investors chase the winners, betting on China’s economic recovery</li>
        <li>BUT, betting on China’s economic recovery in the short term will sting, the economy is a tank and will take a while for it to show. The market is just casting their votes, and the late voters will get hurt.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>JOLTS hot print suggests economic growth, higher inflation expectations, and rising bond yields. As a consequence, less rate cuts expectations.</li>
    <li>ADP hot print suggests again economic expansion, bearish for bonds as inflation increases</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Good for SPX, not so good for IWM</li>
    </ul>
    <li>OXY and Oil keep surging</li>
    <ul>
        Oil is part of the Trump basket since he wants to do more drilling
    </ul>
    <ul>
        However, Middle East geopolitics aren't escalating
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Economics expansion = oil goes up
    </ul>
    <li>ISM very good print. Economic expansion everywhere</li>
    <li>NFP comes in super hot, Gold dips while SPX and BTC spike and retrace.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Gold is correlated to bonds – expansion leads to bonds and gold going down.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Gold is correlated to bonds</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Expansion: bonds and gold go down</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Contraction: bonds and gold go up</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot NFP means big economic expansion, less odds of more interest rate cuts in Q4. Investors exit bonds and gold (safe haven asset) to invest in rish</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Market reacts fast thinking high NFP = economic expansion, which is "good for risk", but too high NFP = less odds of more rate cuts in Q4, and that's bad for risk</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Port workers' drama solved with wage increases. Perhaps, a problem to deal with later.</li>
    <li>Iran and Israel not escalating, for now.</li>
    <ul>
         <li>Note: Israel has generational opportunity to shift Middle Eastern politics. Attacking Iran’s energy infra is on the table. This event followed by Iran’s retaliation will send oil to the moon and create a lot of market vol. Tensions are still high. If anything were to happen, it would be soon.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>China expected to still outperform next week when Chinese investors come back from holiday</li>
    <li>YEN weakening, Nikkei surging as Ishiba mentions dovish policies.</li>
    <li>Economic data shows very good economic growth in the US. Market prices 2x 25bps rate cuts, instead of 1x 50bps this year.</li>
    <li>GBP weakening as governor announces possible faster than expected rate cuts.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>UK joins the global rate cut cycle</li>
    </ul>
    <li>EU also has economic growth concerns, leading to potential rate cut in October. Swiss national bank also showed inflation came in lower than expected, meaning potential for rate cuts there as well.</li>
    <li>Global rate cut cycle in full swing. Middle East escalation still a big worry</li>
</ul>

<h2>7th Oct - 12th Oct Key Takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>China back from holidays but with sharp retrace in HSI as it announces underwhelming path to new monetary policy.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bonds saw money flowing back into them as a consequence</li>
    </ul>
    <li>China retracing is good for US market</li>
    <ul>
        <li>But causes energy down, oil down, metals down</li>
    </ul>
    <li>FOMC minutes: further confirmation of Fed confidence in winning the fight against inflation with the previous 50bps rate cut 3 weeks earlier.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This meeting is about what happened weeks earlier so it’s old news</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Market looks forward to corporate buybacks next week but still data-dependent</li>
    <li>Shaky week considering there is CPI and PPI, and then bank earnings</li>
    <li>Past week prints indicated a lot of economic expansion, maybe too much too fast so this week we test some inflation fears</li>
    <ul>
        <li>CPI prints 0.3% (vs 0.3% previous, 0.2% expected).</li>
        <ul>
            <li>3.6% inflation, way away from target</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Not good, this is inflationary so we look at PPI next</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Jobless claims prints 258k vs 231k prev, 225k exp.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Not good, means high unemployment. Probably due to hurricane</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>PPI prints unchanged (0%), easing inflation fears from previous CPI print. This leads to a good path to be risk on into next week when corporate buybacks are badck and inflation fears are behind us, for now</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PPI is important because it’s in the PCE formula, so it frontruns that print</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Trump election and prediction odds surge as Harris gets grilled on latest Fox News interview, very supportive for markets.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil down, Trump basket up. So, energy and banks back up. Generally, most unregulated stocks. Supposedly, also good for BTC.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Otherwise, the first bank earnings begin with JPM reporting $12B more than forecasted and BLK also beating expectations</li>
</ul>

<h2>14th Oct - 18th Oct Key Takeaways:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Some chasing going on in the market as many hedge funds fear missing out on a potential rally into elections. Still, with some hedging due to retail sales, vixpiration, and OPEX this week</li>
    <li>If market were to sell off (as it historically does right before election) then it would more likely be AFTER OPEX when market is unpinned and has less liq</li>
    <li>Eyes on TSM earnings (indicator for tech growth) and retail sales this week.</li>
    <li>BTC ETFs see $280-400M in inflows ($IBIT).</li>
    <li>Market is up this week. This is mostly due to mechanical dealer flows. The same dynamics repeat every month. After every opex, market sells off as it becomes unpinned, and runs it back shortly after.</li>
    <li>Investors hope for a BTC breakout but only consistent spot buying above 69k will lead it there</li>
    <li>TSM beats exp! CapEx is most important component of these earnings. It tells how much capital do these companies put to work in the next quarters. For AI companies, it’s telling how much they will invest in more AI production, so chips and data centers</li>
    <li>Potential new narrative forming: nuclear stocks. The 2nd stage of shovels: energy. How to power AI?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>FLR and other nuclear stocks surging</li>
    </ul>
    <li>ECB cuts 25bps, bring interest rate from 3.65% to 3.4%</li>
    <li>A lot to look forward to in Q4:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Corporate buybacks, new tax year begins in November for some funds, rebalancing books expected </li>
        <li>S&P is up 20% YTD but volume is insanely low. Some days this week only 30-35M shares were traded. Market is moving solely due to mechanical moves and dealer flows.</li>
        <li>After elections, event vol comes down and more parties will finally rebalance back into the market creating much much more volume</li>
        <li>All the above combined with less liquidity in the market in December due to less trading days (more holidays) is a great catalyst for the market to go up</li>
        <li>But, economic data is expected to deteriorate as there will be much less efforts to improve it after elections, so recession fears will be back, hedging will increase again. These are likely to be squeezed as recession fears are outweighed by the new flows entering the market after event volatility comes off</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Retails sales print hot! [0.5% vs 0.2%, 0.1% exp.]</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Good for the economy. Good data before the election, obviously.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
