        <h1>What happened until now in Q4 2024</h1>


        <h2>18th Nov - 22nd Nov Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earnings: NVDA barely beats earnings, indicating AI narrative remains behind us with semiconductors keep underperforming against Trump basket. Good for BTC: 100k anytime now</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>11th Nov - 15th Nov Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OPEX Week:</strong> The market was pinned around the SPX 6000 strike due to options expiry, limiting significant moves. Post-OPEX, potential macro drivers include bond yields and dollar strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation Data:</strong> CPI and PPI came in as expected, easing fears of runaway inflation but highlighting "sticky" components (shelter, services). Retail sales surprised on the upside, though the control group (GDP component) showed a slight decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Fed Positioning:</strong> Hawkish tone from Fed speakers, including Powell, with emphasis on both employment and price stability. Rate cut expectations for December/January have reduced significantly, indicating slower policy easing.</li>
            <li><strong>Equity Outlook:</strong> While bullish "Santa rally" narratives persist, traders took a more cautious stance, locking in profits and rotating into defensive sectors like consumer staples.</li>
            <li><strong>Crypto Trends:</strong> Increased retail interest in crypto, with Bitcoin's weekend open seen as a directional indicator. Bitcoin keeps outperforming in the Trump trade basket. Concerns remain about Binance's practices (listing memecoins after memecoins), with retail favoring Coinbase or Robinhood for speculative trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Layered bids for potential dips and focus on weekend rallies, exiting altcoins amid increased market caution.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Levels:</strong> Watching SPX 5,980 resistance and 5,630 support. Dollar index levels (106-107) and 10-year yield at 4.5% remain pivotal for macro fund flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Tech Vulnerability:</strong> Concerns over stretched valuations in high-flying tech stocks and insider defensive positioning suggest potential near-term corrections.</li>
            <li><strong>Outlook:</strong> The market remains sensitive to inflation, Fed signals, and seasonal liquidity conditions. Potential for near-term bullish momentum heading into year-end with buybacks offering support in low liquidity environment in December (less trading days), but risks of corrections rise in early 2025.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4th Nov - 8th Nov Key Takeaways:</h2>

            <li><strong>Fed and Economic Outlook:</strong> Fed may delay rate cuts until 2025; sustained high yields and mortgage rates signal tightening conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>China Investment Opportunity:</strong> China likely to stimulate its economy; consider long-term exposure to China’s banks, retailers, and domestic markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Strategy Recommendations:</strong> Hold assets until January; strategic positions in bonds and avoiding reactive market moves advised.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fed Policy and Rate Cuts:</strong> Expected 25bps cut in November, with another likely in December. Fed's neutral rate may stabilize at 3-3.5%, with gradual easing as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Labor Market and Inflation Observations:</strong> Solid GDP growth, cooling labor market, and easing inflation. Some Fed members prefer slower rate cuts despite cooling indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Dynamics and Volatility:</strong> VIX remains around 15-16; equity markets show upside with mechanical flows, limiting CTA re-entries. Key resistance at 5980 for SPX.</li>
            <li><strong>Trading Opportunities:</strong> Tactical positioning in bonds and rate-sensitive sectors; monitor financials for rotation potential. Iron Condors advised for range-bound markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Economic Outlook:</strong> China stimulus impacts, Saudi oil production cuts, and mixed real estate signals. Monitor USD strength and Japanese policy shifts.</li>
            <li><strong>Geopolitical and Economic Risks:</strong> Geopolitical tensions reduced; pressure on gold continues. European growth concerns and China-US dynamics critical for early 2025.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SPX Market Consolidation:</strong> Market likely to stabilize around the 6000 level; 6025 strike acting as a gamma magnet due to JP Morgan call positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Data and Fed Outlook:</strong> Fed closely monitoring unemployment and inflation; probability of a 25bps December rate cut down to 65%. Dips expected to present buying opportunities next week.</li>

            <li><strong>University of Michigan Sentiment:</strong> Positive sentiment and short-term inflation outlook bode well for market optimism.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptocurrency Market Trends:</strong> Bitcoin likely to rise further with iShares Bitcoin ETF options launching; steady upward momentum expected in the market.</li>
        </ul>



        
        <h2>28th Oct - 1st Nov Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <li>Still in a window of weakness this week as <a href="https://github.com/0xf3dz/markets/raw/c58678764f6e0e38d08351ee1ab013fce329d3ca/Vanna%20and%20Charm%20Flows%20During%20OpEx.png" target="_blank">Vanna and Charm are on holiday</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Volatile week expected as market is less liquid with <a href="https://github.com/0xf3dz/markets/raw/39ff2455af81f7eed2013ce8288ceb1b92fc954d/spx_earnings_weight.png" target="_blank">40% of SPX reporting earnings</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Eyes on bond auctions on Monday</li>
        <li>The higher the US10Y goes, the worse it is for risk assets. The threshold is about 4.3% to suggest a risk off environment for investors
            <ul>
                <li>Real yields is just US10Y minus inflation. You call this inflation-adjusted yields.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Real US10Y yields are what is considered the most risk-free investments, as investors can still earn 2% after inflation. If these keep climbing, there isn't much incentive for them to invest in risk assets.</li>
        <li>DXY showing strength as other countries economies are contracting in comparison to the US</li>
        <li>Market anticipates a Trump victory, resulting in deficit increase and introduction of tariffs. This reignites inflation and leads to Central Banks to not cut further. This is not the case in other countries: UK, EU, Canada or Japan. But these countries do have weaker economies and slower inflation, with their central banks that keep cutting rates. This keeps strengthening the US Dollar and keeps bond yields high
            <ul>
                <li>This dynamic is all due to Trump's tariff policy, leading to higher prices in imported goods and services (e.g. European, Mexican and Chinese goods)</li>
                <li>This is an inflationary policy</li>
                <li>Tariffs means companies are forced to come back to manufacture in the US, which increases wages, which is inflationary as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>JOLTS come in cold
            <ul>
                <li>This is good for yields to come lower, so good for risk assets</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Consumer Confidence comes in hot. Good for the market</li>
        <li>GOOG, AMD, MSFT and META beat earnings</li>
        <li>LLY, MSTR and COIN miss earnings</li>
        <li>Market remains hedged despite Trump odds surging
            <ul>
                <li>Skew still high, no interest in calls, only interest is in out of the money puts</li>
                <li>High skew = way more demand for puts than calls</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Yields keep staying high as market anticipates structural inflation if Trump wins</li>
        <li>Gold and commodities keep performing well</li>
        <li>Huge beat for ADP Nonfarm Employment
            <ul>
                <li>Not good for bonds. Yields expected to keep surging</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>High real yields not favorable for the market. But it's supportive for tech, gold and silver. Supposedly good for BTC as well</li>
        <li>Earnings almost coming to an end</li>
        <li>Q3 GDP comes in cold</li>
        <li>Core MoM PCE comes in line at 0.3%</li>
        <ul>
            <li>PCE is more indicative of inflation because CPI is too heavy weighted in housing</li>
            <li>PCE is more oriented towards daily or monthly services (insurances, car repairs etc.)</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Employment Cost Index comes in colder at 0.8% vs 0.9% prev</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If higher, employees are wealthier, earn more due to salary increases, which is inflationary</li>
            <li>If lower, then it's the opposite</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Personal Spending comes in slightly hotter, other than this rest of economic data is nothing burger.</li>
        <li>Market has pretty much priced in a Trump victory</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Gold and BTC surged while bonds are still selling off</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Next week eyes on US election, Central Banks policy decisions (FOMC and BOE) and China's CPI/PPI. According to GS, investors eagerly awaiting to deploy capital once election is behind us.</li>
        <li>Earnings coming to an end soon. More companies are beating consensus estimates by at least 1SD, beats are being rewarded by more than the historical aveage while misses are not being as severely punished</li>
        <li>52% of the 351 S&P companies that reported have beat street wide earnings estimates by >1SD while 14% have missed estimates by >1SD</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/0xf3dz/markets/raw/e1422af7675345c5da83b7e78d30b0eb7ec912fe/s%26p%20earnings%20vs%20misses.png" target="_blank">See Frequency of S&P500 earnings surprises</a></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Buybacks are coming back. Companies are estimated to place discretionary buyback orders 1-2 days post earnings release</li>
        <li>Trump odds fell 4% on Polymarket on Thursday as speculators bought more Kamala shares. In line with how the SPX retraced due to mega cap tech earnings. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Market seems more levered to a Republican win</li>
        </ul>
        <li>SPX fell -1.4% this week, as a result of impactful earnings, MF fiscal YE dynamics and election de-grossing. Non Profitable Tech, Regional Banks and Capex Beneficiaries were the themes that led the pace of gains while Bitcoin Sensitive equities (MSTR, COIN, HOOD), Obesity Drugs (LLY) and retail favorites underperformed</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Corporate buybacks expected to be $6B worth of demand per day in Nov. GS likes Financials, Value, Transport and Industrials</li>
            <li>LOs (long-only funds) sold $10bn in US equities this week (degrossing into election) while HFs saw no outsized selling (did they already degrossed?)</li>
            <li>NDX futs outperformed SPX this week as 5 of Mag7 were expected to report earnings</li>
            <li>SPX skew is very high. Opportunity in buying put spreads before election given the potential market downside after a Democratic win</li>
            <li>Overall, major trading desks are bullish risk going into election</li>
            <li>Top performers this week: Non profitable tech, AI, Regional Banks and Capex Beneficiaries</li>
            <li>Bottom performers this week: BTC sensitive equities, PC AI upgrades, Obesity drugs, Commodity Sensitive and Retail favorites</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>21st Oct - 25th Oct Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <li>Bond yields going up suggest the Fed rate cut was a policy mistake
            <ul>
                <li>Yields are expected to go down after a rate cut cause existing bond prices suddenly look more appealing with a higher yield</li>
                <li>The fact yields are going up, and bond prices going down, means investors would rather not buy the existing bonds because they are not confident in their creditworthiness, which is concerning</li>
                <li>Why is it concerning? Because it means the market believes the Fed’s decision in cutting rates was not a good one. Interest rate cuts are supposed to facilitate consumer borrowing. But if yields go high, especially 10-year bonds, then interest rates for non-durable goods are actually rising.</li>
                <li>If that happens then the economy will slow down which is the opposite of what the Fed attempted to do in the first place.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What can the Fed do next?
                        <ul>
                            <li>QE. Print more money and buy these bonds.</li>
                            <li>This creates even more US deficit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A broad sell-off could indicate that investors expect higher future inflation or interest rates. If inflation expectations rise, the real return on bonds (after adjusting for inflation) diminishes, making them less attractive.</li>
        <li>If investors think the Fed will raise rates in the future to combat inflation or other risks, they might sell bonds in anticipation of lower bond prices later.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This creates a doom loop:
                <ul>
                    <li>Economy improves -> fed cuts rates to lower inflation -> but inflation exp rise -> yields go up -> Fed does QE or rate hike -> economy improves -> fed cuts rates (and so on)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Other than the above, this week is slow, right after OPEX. Market is unpinned and will be more volatile. All eyes on the election (Trump odds leading SPX) and $8B in corporate buybacks starting soon.</li>
        <li>BOC 50bps rate cut</li>
        <li>TSLA beats earnings with biggest gap up in years</li>
        <li>Palladium up a lot as best metal for upside due to potential Russian sanctions</li>
        <li>PMI comes in slightly hot - nothing burger</li>
        <li>Durable goods comes in hot</li>
        <li>PBOC meeting on Nov 20th, expected to copy FOMC decision in Nov 7th</li>


        <h2>14th Oct - 18th Oct Key Takeaways:</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li>Some chasing going on in the market as many hedge funds fear missing out on a potential rally into elections. Still, with some hedging due to retail sales, vixpiration, and OPEX this week</li>
                 <li>If market were to sell off (as it historically does right before election) then it would more likely be AFTER OPEX when market is unpinned and has less liq</li>
                <li>Eyes on TSM earnings (indicator for tech growth) and retail sales this week.</li>
                <li>BTC ETFs see $280-400M in inflows ($IBIT).</li>
                <li>Market is up this week. This is mostly due to mechanical dealer flows. The same dynamics repeat every month. After every opex, market sells off as it becomes unpinned, and runs it back shortly after.</li>
                <li>Investors hope for a BTC breakout but only consistent spot buying above 69k will lead it there</li>
                <li>TSM beats exp! CapEx is most important component of these earnings. It tells how much capital do these companies put to work in the next quarters. For AI companies, it’s telling how much they will invest in more AI production, so chips and data centers</li>
                <li>Potential new narrative forming: nuclear stocks. The 2nd stage of shovels: energy. How to power AI?
                    <ul>
                        <li>FLR and other nuclear stocks surging</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>ECB cuts 25bps, bring interest rate from 3.65% to 3.4%</li>
                <li>China beats across the board</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HSI sees strength again. What happens next week?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Next week weakness expected as there is no dealer flows [monthly OPEX on FRIDAY 18th]</li>
                <li>Harris gets grilled in a Fox News interview. Trump odds keep surging.</li>
                <li>Trump odds surging consequences:
                    <ul>
                        <li>BTC surging - Trump is pro crypto. His campaigns reduces financial regulations. BTC good proxy for it.</li>
                        <li>DJT surging - Trump’s media company</li>
                        <li>Equities in general - S&P has positive correlation with Trump odds</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Trump’s tariff policy
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use tariff as negotiating tool to get businesses to build in US</li>
                        <li>If China doesnt build factories and create jobs in US, to sell goods to americans, they will get charged tariffs to [build good in china] sell chinese goods to americans</li>
                        <li>The goal is to reduce US trade deficit: US imports much more than it exports</li>
                        <li>But Trump's tariffs are inflationary and can do more harm than good for Americans in the short term.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>A lot to look forward to in Q4:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corporate buybacks, new tax year begins in November for some funds, rebalancing books expected </li>
                        <li>S&P is up 20% YTD but volume is insanely low. Some days this week only 30-35M shares were traded. Market is moving solely due to mechanical moves and dealer flows.</li>
                        <li>After elections, event vol comes down and more parties will finally rebalance back into the market creating much much more volume</li>
                        <li>All the above combined with less liquidity in the market in December due to less trading days (more holidays) is a great catalyst for the market to go up</li>
                        <li>But, economic data is expected to deteriorate as there will be much less efforts to improve it after elections, so recession fears will be back, hedging will increase again. These are likely to be squeezed as recession fears are outweighed by the new flows entering the market after event volatility comes off</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Retails sales print hot! [0.5% vs 0.2%, 0.1% exp.]
                    <ul>
                        <li>Good for the economy. Good data before the election, obviously.</li>

                <li>Market looks forward to corporate buybacks next week but still data-dependent</li>
                <li>Shaky week considering there is CPI and PPI, and then bank earnings</li>
                <li>Past week prints indicated a lot of economic expansion, maybe too much too fast so this week we test some inflation fears</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPI prints 0.3% (vs 0.3% previous, 0.2% expected).</li>

                <li>Not good, means high unemployment. Probably due to hurricane</li>
                <li>PPI prints unchanged (0%), easing inflation fears from previous CPI print. This leads to a good path to be risk on into next week when corporate buybacks are badck and inflation fears are behind us, for now</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>PPI is important because it’s in the PCE formula, so it frontruns that print</li>

                    <li>Oil down, Trump basket up. So, energy and banks back up. Generally, most unregulated stocks. Supposedly, also good for BTC.</li>

                <li>Nike earnings this week – often used by boomers to gauge consumer inflation.</li>
                <li>Oil finally surges after Iran attacks Israel, market prices odds of escalation in the Middle East.</li>

                    <li>BUT, betting on China’s economic recovery in the short term will sting, the economy is a tank and will take a while for it to show. The market is just casting their votes, and the late voters will get hurt.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>JOLTS hot print suggests economic growth, higher inflation expectations, and rising bond yields. As a consequence, less rate cuts expectations.</li>

                    <li>Hot NFP means big economic expansion, less odds of more interest rate cuts in Q4. Investors exit bonds and gold (safe haven asset) to invest in rish</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market reacts fast thinking high NFP = economic expansion, which is "good for risk", but too high NFP = less odds of more rate cuts in Q4, and that's bad for risk</li>
                </ul>
                    <li>Port workers' drama solved with wage increases. Perhaps, a problem to deal with later.</li>
                    <li>Iran and Israel not escalating, for now.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: Israel has generational opportunity to shift Middle Eastern politics. Attacking Iran’s energy infra is on the table. This event followed by Iran’s retaliation will send oil to the moon and create a lot of market vol. Tensions are still high. If anything were to happen, it would be soon.</li>
